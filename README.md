# MAMMOth-commons

Fast component development for the MAMMOth fairness toolkit.
Components refer to model loaders, dataset loaders, or metrics.
The library holds common datatypes that are shared between
components, and automates the integration strategy by only
needing to add a decorator.

## :microscope: Investigate fairness

This repo includes a thinned down variation of the MAMMOth toolkit
that you can quickly install and run locally.

## :clipboard: Catalogue

Find a catalogue of modules implemented by the MAMMOth consortium
[here](catalogue/README.md). These modules are developed by and
depend on datatypes found in commons.

## :thumbsup: Contributing

Instructions on how to add new modules are [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Use the GitHub issue tracker to ask questions, request 
features/improvements for the core library or modules, or report bugs.

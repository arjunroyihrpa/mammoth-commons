    """
    <p>Generates a fairness and bias report using the <a href="https://github.com/mever-team/FairBench">FairBench</a>
    library. This explores many kinds of bias to paint a broad picture and help you decide on what is problematic
    and what is acceptable behavior.
    The generated report can be viewed in three different formats, where the model card contains a subset of
    results but attaches to these socio-technical concerns to be taken into account:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A summary table of results.</li>
        <li>A simplified model card that includes concerns.</li>
        <li>The full report, including details.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The module's report summarizes how a model behaves on a provided dataset across different population groups.
    These groups are based on sensitive attributes like gender, age, and race. Each attribute can have multiple values,
    such as several genders or races. Numeric attributes, like age, are normalized to the range [0,1] and treated
    as fuzzy values, where 0 indicates membership to a fuzzy group of "small" values, and 1 indicates membership to
    a fuzzy group of "large" values. A separate set of fairness metrics is calculated for each prediction label.</p>

    <p>If intersectional subgroup analysis is enabled, separate subgroups are created for each combination of sensitive
    attribute values. However, if there are too many attributes, some groups will be small or empty. Empty groups are
    ignored in the analysis. The report may also include information about built-in datasets.</p>

    Args:
        intersectional: Whether to consider all non-empty group intersections during analysis. This does nothing if there is only one sensitive attribute. It could be computationally intensive if too many group intersections are selected.
        compare_groups: Whether to compare groups pairwise, or each group to the behavior of the whole population.
        problematic_deviation: Sets up a threshold of when to consider deviation from ideal values as problematic. If nothing is considered problematic fairness is not necessarily achieved, but this is a good way to identify the most prominent biases. If value of 0 is set, all report values are shown, including those that have no ideal value.
        show_non_problematic: Determine whether deviations less than the problematic one should be shown or not. If they are shown, the coloring scheme is adjusted to identify problematic values as red.

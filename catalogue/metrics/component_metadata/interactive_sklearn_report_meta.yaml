name: interactive sklearn report
description: "Creates an interactive report using the FairBench library, after running\
  \ an internal training-test split\n    on a basic sklearn model. The report creates\
  \ traceable evaluations that you can shift through to find sources\n    of unfairness\
  \ on a common task.\n\n    Args:\n        predictor: Which sklearn predictor should\
  \ be used.\n        intersectional: Whether to consider all non-empty group intersections\
  \ during analysis. This does nothing if there is only one sensitive attribute.\n\
  \        pairwise_comparison: Whether to compare groups pairwise. Otherwise, each\
  \ group is compared to the whole population.\n    \n    Options:\n        predictor:\
  \ logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes"

name: interactive logistic regression report
description: "Creates an interactive report using the FairBench library, after running\
  \ an internal training-test split\n    on a basic sklearn model. The report creates\
  \ traceable evaluations that you can shift through to find sources\n    of unfairness\
  \ on a common task.\n\n    Args:\n        intersectional: Whether to consider all\
  \ non-empty group intersections during analysis. This does nothing if there is only\
  \ one sensitive attribute.\n        pairwise_comparison: Whether to compare groups\
  \ pairwise. Otherwise, each group is compared to the whole population.\n    "
